# demoqa

In this project I automated the Form page of the DemoQA website. I also automated the Bookstore API.
I used the Playwright framework together with Typescript.

To run the test locally, create a .env file with 
API_URL=https://demoqa.com
REQRES_API=https://reqres.in/api

You need to install npm install @faker-js/faker playwright
